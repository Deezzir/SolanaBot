# TODO

- Add Volume bot
- Add sell by percent to start/snipe command
- Detect Raydium migration and change price update strategy
  - Ray Price Calc: [solask](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/11939/calculation-of-tocken-price-for-example-sol-usdc)
  - Detection: [codebase](https://github.com/warp-id/solana-trading-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration)
  - Another example: [code](https://gist.github.com/endrsmar/684c336c3729ec4472b2f337c50c3cdb)
  - Logic?:
    - Update and monitor price coming from Pump
    - Detect if the curve is complete(run onLogs in bg to check if `init` instruction occured)
    - Subscribe to Raydium AMM to detect migration (done by prev step)
    - Update metadata `raydium_pool` for the trade commands
    - Switch price monitoring to another source (some RPC API or direct blockchain monitoring using Ray AMM)
- Wallet stats, like age, number of bonds and winrate. (new command?)
  - Wallet win rate
    - Logic?
      - Get all txs from a wallet pub key (multiple reqs)
      - Determine all buy txs(Pump, Ray, Moonshot?)
      - Using a mint from each buy tx, find every sell tx (may be multiple)
      - Determine gains in %
      - Calculate average on all buy/sell gain pairs (or other aggregate?)
      - Maybe other metrics can be added (to discuss)
- Pump Fun Shill, comments creation
- Introduce bundled sells and buys
- Pump/Moonshot Volume (and bump bot)
- Cache, optimizations
- PumpSwap
-
